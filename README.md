## Installation and basic usage

[Installation and basic usage](./doc/start-web-server.md)



## Generating the miniwasp test data

1. Install the package as above
1. [Install docker](./doc/docker-installation.md)
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/flatironinstitute/field-slicer`
1. Make sure you are in the appropriate conda environment

Join the CCM test channel if not already joined (so that the test data can be downloaded):

```bash
kachery-p2p-join-channel https://gist.githubusercontent.com/magland/542b2ef7c268eb99d87d7b965567ece0/raw/ccm-test-channel.yaml
```


Run the example:
```bash
# after cloning or updating this repo
cd field-slicer
cd examples
python test_miniwasp.py
```

This will create a few .vtk files (e.g., surf.vtk, surfx.vtk, ...)

You can open these in [paraview](./doc/paraview-installation.md), for example:

```bash
paraview surf.vtk
# Then in the GUI, click the eye icon next to surf.vtk
```
